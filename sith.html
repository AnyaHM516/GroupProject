      <p> The Sith are the antagonistic power in the Star Wars universe and represent the 'dark side' of the force. The do not uphold the Jedi's beliefs in peace or balance, and instead pursue power, control and often imperialistic expansion across the universe.</p>

        <h3> the force </h3>
        <p> While the Jedi connect to the force through calmness and meditation, the Sith channel their anger, passion or hate to use their powers. This often makes them stronger than average force users, with abilities such as choking others and using lightning. </p>

        <h3> beliefs </h3>
        <p> The Sith originally emerged from an internal war within the Jedi order as some believed the path to true power was through using their emotions, instead of controlling and supressing them. Their focus on power comes out in political affiliations to the Empire and later to the First Order, both militaristic and fascist political movements.</p>

        <h3> history </h3>
        <p> The Sith were originally Jedi who leant towards the dark side of the force. Following an internal struggle, they split from the Jedi order and set up their own religious movement. Within this Sith Lords were seen as the highest ranking members and carried the title 'Darth' e.g. Darth Vader, Darth Maul or Darth Sidious. A prophecy foretold the end of the Sith and the return of balance to the force, and with the death of Darth Vader in Episode 6, this prophecy was fulfilled. Despite the end of the Sith as an Order, there were still those after it which followed the dark side.</p>

        <h3> notable characters </h3>
        <p> The most notable Sith character is Darth Vader (previously known as Anakin Skywalker), who is arguably the main character of the entire franchise. His turn from the light to the dark marked the height of the Sith's power and the end of the Jedi. Other characters of note include Chancellor Palpatine/Darth Sidious and Count Duko, who encouraged Anakin to turn, as well as Darth Maul, who killed Obi-Wan's master Qui-Gon Jinn.  </p>
