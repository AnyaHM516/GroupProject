        <h3> the force </h3>
        <p> The Force is something that is introduced in the Star Wars and forms the foundation for many of the plots. It can best be described as the 'magic' of this universe, giving it's users the ability to push and pull objects, use lightning, sense important developments elsewhere in the universe and even communicate telepathically. While all living people and creatures in the Star Wars universe have the Force in them, only a select few have the ability to consciously sense and manipulate it. The Jedi are all force-users, but only use the 'light' side of this, found through a meditative mental state of peace and calm. While they use it to fight, some uses are forbidden such as choking others and using lightning.</p>
